# Package data

This package provides basic utilities for working with data, e.g.
sorting and other wrapper interfaces.

It also provides sub-packages for working with data structures,
which integrate well with `data` itself.

- [`list`](./list/) - for basic containers like stacks, queues, and sets

- [`graph`](./graph/) - for graph types

- [`tree`](./tree/)- for trees, like BST and heap
