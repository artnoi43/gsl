# Graph data structures
Each subpackage in this package provides basic building block and my personal reference implementations for a type of graph. These are the following subpackages:

- `wgraph` for weighted graphs (directional/undirectional weighted graphs).

- `ugraph` for unweighted graphs (directional/undirectional unweighted graphs).
